Lava plane = 111+ the actual combat area.
Pillars = 1,18,1
Walls = 21,4.8,1
Ground = 65, 61, 65
Scale = 1/4th
Bridge distances = 47 (adjusted with platform size=28)
Spawn location size=5, 1.2, 5
Armor size:1, 2.4, 2
Bridge -
Small floor block:15,1.2,2
Large floor block:15,1.2,8
9 bricks. LSLSLSLSL
Slight correction. Apparently, bridges are 12 units long. This means every location should actually be 16.25+12. I can't remember which thing I measured 47 in, but it's definitely wrong.
Bottom side brick Middle:10, 2.4, 1
Bottom side brick Edge:9, 2.4, 1
Side brick type I:4,2.4,1
Side brick type II:4,1.2,1
Side brick type III:2,1.2,1
Side brick type IV:3,2.4,1
Positioning of the side bricks:I II I II I III IV III I II I II I
bottom brick needs Y = .15
Top brick needs Y = .75 or .6 based on I, IV or II, III 
All bricks are offset by X=2
I've fucked up the scaling here.
I could fix all of the bridges but frankly, I don't want to.
I'm just going to make III bigger and hope noone notices the strange discrepancy in gameply.
