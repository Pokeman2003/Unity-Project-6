1.3 v12.2021.1
Changes from v11.2021.1:
New Features:
- The Asset SDK Asset Localizer is now known as the Asset Fixer!
	- Added the ability to "fix" all asset URLs by changing them to a URL of your choice!
- The Asset SDK's Asset Fixer now properly supports fixing the URLs inside of scripts.
- Added T-Shirt support to 2007E/2007E-Shaders.
	- T-Shirts with Roblox Asset URLs/Redirects are not supported due to 2 issues with 2007e: Roblox Asset URLs/Redirects do not work properly in 2007E if it's a texture and using anything to get the current texture value for a ShirtGraphic or Decal returns a "bad cast" error.
	- As a result, T-Shirts with Roblox Asset URLs/Redirects will not load in 2007e.
- Added ClientScript Variables:
	- %tshirttexid%, %shirttexid%, %pantstexid%, %facetexid% - Returns the texture URL for the respective online clothing type. Returns nothing if the URL is invalid, the item isn't using Online Clothing, or %localizeonlineclothing% is not defined in the script.
	- %tshirttexidlocal%, %shirttexidlocal%, %pantstexidlocal%, %facetexlocal%" - Returns the texture rbxasset URL for the respective online clothing type. Returns nothing if the URL is invalid, the item isn't using Online Clothing, or %localizeonlineclothing% is not defined in the script. Only the client who downloads the clothing would be able to see it. 
	- %localizeonlineclothing% - Grabs texture IDS for the %texid% variables and localizes the texture for the %texidlocal% variables. This WILL increase load times of your client depending on how many items are being downloaded.
	- %newgui% - Returns if the 2011L interface is enabled on 2011M clients. Can be used as a toggle switch for other client-side CoreScript features.
- Users may now use a image URL to load custom icons.
	- Icons loaded from a URL will show up for all players.
