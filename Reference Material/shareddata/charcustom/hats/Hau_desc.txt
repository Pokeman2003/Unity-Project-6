The Kanohi Hau is the Mask of Shielding. 
It allows its user to protect themselves from any physical attack that they are aware of by generating a force field. 
The only difference between the Great and Noble versions is that the Great version forms a stronger and longer-lasting 
shield than the Noble version.
