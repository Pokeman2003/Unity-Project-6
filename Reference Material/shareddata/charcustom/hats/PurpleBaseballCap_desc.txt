This pink and lavender baseball cap has a picture of a pony on it! Who doesn't like ponies?






My Little Pony, My Little Pony
Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahhh...

My Little Pony
I used to wonder what friendship could be
Until you all shared its magic with me

Big adventure
Tons of fun
A beautiful heart
Faithful and strong
Sharing kindness!
It's an easy feat
And magic makes it all complete

You have my little ponies
Do you know you're all my very best friends?
